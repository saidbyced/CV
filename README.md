## Christopher Eadie (but you can call me Ced)

I am English, turned kiwi (New Zealander), turned English with a love of personal accountability and growth. I've lived and worked in three countries, spent about 20 years in various forms of customer-support/service and self-studied Swift before I came to Makers to learn software/web development. I love people and ultimately, that's what tech is all about - done well, it takes the best of humanity and enables us to do/be more of what makes us great.

I have a heavily analytical mind with a people focus. I have learned a lot about people, both through interaction and personal study - they facinate and inspire me. I have led basic coding workshops and did basic troubleshooting while working at Apple (White City) and have been 'the IT guy ("did you try turning it off and on again?") for friends, family and colleagues for, well...ever since I can remember. I love to help

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Analytical/Process-driven (including documentation)

- I have often been behind the organisation (or re-organisation) of systems and process at previous workplaces. I usually create processes and write procedural documentation for them as I go. My handover to whomever I train to replace me is always as smooth and stress-free as I can make it - they often receive a small folder detailing what I do and how to do it.
- During my time at Notting Hill Housing Group I wrote a basic user manual (colour-coded and with images) for a group of new users. I also reorganised the property key storage procedures, making them simpler, more efficient and more secure. During my time at Enjoy Technology I helped create some of the training material for UK Experts, created basic processes for tracking new phones and uniform when we first started and lead workshops on optimisation/tweaking of 'Pre-Visit communication'.

#### Customer (including internal customer) focus

- I have had the priviledge of working for a couple of companies with amazing values - these stand-outs being Apple and Enjoy. I love being involved in working out how we can best serve our customers in a realistic, responsible and sustainable way.
- I was one of the training leads at both Apple and Enjoy with a focus both on company culture and logistical role related processes. At Enjoy I changed the structure of 'Pre-Visit communication' at Enjoy to maximise both the Expert and customer enjoyment and safety.
