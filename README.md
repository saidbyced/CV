## Hi, I'm Chris (but you can call me Ced)

I am English, turned kiwi (New Zealander), turned English with a love of personal accountability and growth. I've lived and worked in three countries, spent about 20 years in various forms of customer-support/service and self-studied Swift; all before I came to Makers to learn software/web development. I love people and ultimately, that's what tech is all about - done well, it takes the best of humanity and enables us to do/be more of what makes us great.

I have a heavily analytical mind with a people focus. I have learned a lot about people, both through interaction and personal study - they facinate and inspire me. I have led basic coding workshops and did basic troubleshooting while working at Apple (Westfield - London) and have been 'the IT guy' ("did you try turning it off and on again?") for friends, family and colleagues for, well...ever since I can remember. I love to help.

## Skills

#### Analytical/Process-driven (including documentation)

- I have often been behind the organisation (or re-organisation) of systems and process at previous workplaces. I usually create processes and write procedural documentation for them as I go. My handover to whomever I train to replace me is always as smooth and stress-free as I can make it - they often receive a small folder detailing what I do and how to do it.
- During my time at Notting Hill Housing Group I wrote a basic user manual (colour-coded and with images) for a group of new users. I also reorganised the property key storage procedures, making them simpler, more efficient and more secure. During my time at Enjoy Technology I helped create some of the training material for UK Experts, created basic processes for tracking new phones and uniform when we first started and lead workshops on optimisation/tweaking of 'Pre-Visit communication'.

#### Customer (including internal customer) focus

- I have had the priviledge of working for a couple of companies with amazing values - these stand-outs being Apple and Enjoy. I love being involved in working out how we can best serve our customers in a realistic, responsible and sustainable way.
- I was one of the training leads at both Apple and Enjoy with a focus both on company culture and logistical role related processes. At Enjoy I changed the structure of 'Pre-Visit communication' at Enjoy to maximise both the Expert and customer enjoyment and safety.

#### UX (User Experience)

Even before I knew what UX was, I loved the idea of it. How do you make something easy, simple, accessible and useful all at the same time. I have been dealing with UX concerns in the physical world from the time I worked at McDonalds and during my times at Apple and Enjoy.
- At Enjoy I went on to gain digital, hands-on experience in helping to create and iterate on product training for new Experts and Captains. This allowed me to use the awareness I had gained previously in a new way I thoroughly enjoy. In the end, it's mostly about removing anything that impedes direct access to what the user needs/wants; KISS (Keep It Stratregically Simple).
